## Dataset

The dataset for testing (graphs) is stored in the "graphs" folder. You can generate new data for testing with a script ("graphs.py").

## Running 

The program works in terminal (console version). The GUI  is under development. Please run the script with "menu.py"

Running is really easy. The only thing you need is [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

Python version required: 3.10

Check your version

```
python3 -V
```

Install Python 3.10 on Ubuntu 20.04|18.04 using Apt Repo


```
# Getting Started
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
```

Install the required dependency for adding custom PPAs.

```
sudo apt install software-properties-common -y
```

Then proceed and add the deadsnakes PPA to the APT package manager sources list as below

```
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:deadsnakes/ppa
```

With the deadsnakes repository added to your Ubuntu 20.04|18.04 system, now download Python 3.10 with the single command below.
```
sudo apt install python3.10
```
Python base interpreter does require some additional modules so install 
```
sudo apt install python3.10-distutils
```



Create a virtual environment via the command:

    python3 -m venv venv

This creates the folder `venv/` in your current directory. It will contain the necessary libraries for running the examples.

To activate the virtual environment, use the following command:

```
# On Windows:
call venv\Scripts\activate.bat
# On Mac / Linux:
source venv/bin/activate
```

Now execute the following to install the necessary dependencies:

    pip install -Ur src/requirements.txt

You'll find a `.py` file there, typically `main.py`. You can run it with the command:

    python src/main.py 

Please note that the virtual environment must still be active for this to work.


## Using PySide2

This repository uses PyQt5 to use Qt from Python. Another, alternative binding is PySide2 (also called "Qt for Python"). It is less mature than PyQt5 but has the advantage that you can use it for free in commercial projects.

If you want to use PySide2 instead of PyQt5, simply replace all mentions of the latter by the former. For instance, in [`src/requirements.txt`](src/requirements.txt), replace `PyQt5` by `PySide2`. Similarly for any code examples: `from PyQt5.QtWidgets ...` becomes `from PySide2.QtWidgets ...` etc.
